#Summary
Quantif-I is your solution for experimentation and personal data analysis. Is that new meditation program really helping? Does adjusing your sleep schedule make you feel better rested? How many birds really are outside your window? Quantif-I provides a platform for managing experiments and collecting data over time, and then helps you draw actionable insights from that information. Simply log in, create a new experiment, and begin logging your data over time. You can see everything youâ€™ve collected, and analyze your data using graphs and statistics.
